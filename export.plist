<!--
I use this to create an ad-hoc IPA file from a provisioning profile, but it only works for me as the account owner:

- Request a certificate using Keychain Access, enter my email and a common name of adhoc-distribution.
- Save the certificate signing request to disk when prompted.
- Create a certificate for iOS distribution in the Apple website and upload the CSR file when prompted.
- Download the .CER file and double click to install the public + private keys in Keychain Access
- Create an Ad Hoc distribution provisioning profile called FinalMobileAppAdHocProfile linked to the certificate and download it.
- In Xcode / Signing & Capabilities, import the provisioning profile file, to save it at ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles.
- Get the UUID by operning the binary FinalMobileAppAdHocProfile.mobileprovision file in a text editor.
- Get the SHA1 hash of the certificate from Keychain Access / Login / Apple certificate properties / Fingerprints.
