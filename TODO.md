## Simplify cert deployment

Use these commands in script:

- xcrun simctl keychain booted add-root-cert ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
- simctl keychain reset

Simplify README and merge.

## Make iOS configuration simpler

Remove reactivate config settings and update blog posts.\
It distracts from my intended meaning and looks non standard.

## Switch to private URI schemes

Make this more natural, without other settings being redundant.\
Update iOS blog post.

## Update iOS Infra Blog Post

This should have a real solution rather than having a negative outcome.
Then reduce README.

## iOS Screenshots

Update these while I am on the MacBook.
