Carthage instructions:
https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start

Install SwiftLint.pkg as a prerequisite by downloading and running the PKG file
We execute 'swiftlint' as a Run Script under Build Phases

Enable this on iOS devices and simulators:
Settings / Passwords and Accounts / Autofill Passwords

1. ForgeRock articles on AppAuth iOS customization:

MAIN FUNCTIONALITY
------------------
1. Secure storage of tokens in the key chain

2. Prerequisites - require secured device

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
------------------
1. Am I using coroutines correctly and avoiding calling APIs on UI thread
   Debug output current thread id

2. Use an array of promises for token renewal
   Understand locking / concurrency in Swift

3. Okta to get working and use logout strategies

4. Side by side compare with Android sample for variable names etc
   Improve Android code

5. Leftover data in ViewManager problem
   Use companies2 URL when logged out
   User info last error is login_required and new error is api_request_error
   The api_request_error triggers a login prompt and should not
   This area needs a rethink

6. UI bugs: Reload shifts existing view right
   User Info error text is not correctly vertically aligned
   Make buttons slightly rounded

7. Stack traces to improve
   Pass stack traces to uiError from system errors

8. Long press to invoke 500 error
   Will require a boolean field in the published event
   API client to receive request options

9. Fix warnings in debug window and compare with AppAuth sample:
   * Attempting to load the view of a view controller while it is deallocating is not allowedand may result in undefined behavior
   * Failed to write file "default.profraw": Read-only file system
   * Can't end BackgroundTask: no background task exists with identifier 2 (0x2), or it may have already been ended.
     Break in UIApplicationEndBackgroundTaskError() to debug.

WEB / DESKTOP SAMPLES
---------------------
1. getAccessToken to call refreshAccessToken and not to throw login required itself
   All samples should do this

2. Above ViewManager problem for Desktop sample (and maybe SPA)

3. Android to implement ErrorHandler.fromMessage
   AuthenticatorImpl to check for response null and throw an exception if required

4. Side by side compare with mobile samples for variable names etc

INTERSTITIAL PROBLEM DETAILS
----------------------------
1. iOS and return after login
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/356
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/232
   Second scene constructor is called when I open a custom scheme URL from a browser
   For now I've removed interstitial page and Auth Server returns directly to custom scheme URL

DEEP LINK SETUP
---------------
1. Online file hosted in S3 and available over this CloudFront URL.
   Edit metadata of S3 file and set Content-Type=application/json.
   https://authguidance-examples.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

2. Entitlements.plist enables app links

3. Under XCode / Targets / Signing + Capabilities / Associated Domains, set this:
   applinks:authguidance-examples.com

4. Bundle identifier under Targets / Signing + Capabilities is as follows:
   com.authguidance.basicmobileapp

5. Verify the applink on this site, using the team id as the Apple App Prefix:
   https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/#resultsbox

6. Test with this command on a simulator:
   xcrun simctl openurl booted https://authguidance-examples.com#company=2

7. Troubleshoot by uninstalling app from simulator, then running the MacOS Console tool.
   Filter on app-site and you may see an error like this.
   In my case this was due to SSL trust problems when running the Charles proxy.
