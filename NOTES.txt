INTERSTITIAL PAGE PROBLEM
-------------------------
1. iOS and return after login
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/356
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/232
   Second scene constructor is called when I open a custom scheme URL from a browser
   For now I've removed interstitial page and Auth Server returns directly to custom scheme URL

DEEP LINK SETUP
---------------
1. Online file hosted in S3 and available over this CloudFront URL.
   Edit metadata of S3 file and set Content-Type=application/json.
   https://authguidance-examples.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

2. Entitlements.plist enables app links

3. Under XCode / Targets / Signing + Capabilities / Associated Domains, set this:
   applinks:authguidance-examples.com

4. Bundle identifier under Targets / Signing + Capabilities is as follows:
   com.authguidance.basicmobileapp

5. Verify the applink on this site, using the team id as the Apple App Prefix:
   https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/#resultsbox

6. Test with this command on a simulator:
   xcrun simctl openurl booted https://authguidance-examples.com#company=2

7. Troubleshoot by uninstalling app from simulator, then running the MacOS Console tool.
   Filter on app-site and you may see an error like this.
   In my case this was due to SSL trust problems when running the Charles proxy.
